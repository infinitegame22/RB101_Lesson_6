Given the triangle of consecutive odd numbers:
            1
         3     5    
      7     9    11   
  13    15    17    19  
21    23    25    27    29 
...

Calculate the sum of the numbers in the nth row of this triangle. e.g. (Input --> Output)

1 -->  1
2 --> 3 + 5 = 8

    current_row_array = [] # This will hold the odd elements on each row
    until current_row_array.size == element_tracker # Does this make it clearer?
      # The element_tracker determines how many odd element current_row_array 
    #should get in each iteration

      current_odd_number += 2 # adding 2 to an odd number gives us the next odd

   #the next current_array/ triangle level should have +1 elements

=begin
the sort_by method considers the return of the block and take the sub-array
as actual integers instead of string numbers.  Just with the integers themselves.
It tells sort by to output subarrays based on the integer valuse of the numbers.
Convert just for the purposes to compare by integer value rather than string value.


Why is sort not doing the sort by is doing. Bunch of elements in the collection based
on what you ask it to do.  Tell sort by to sort this colelction based on this condition.
  Ascending to descending order. Before I sort a number, I have to call what is a comparison
  operation.  I know when I sort this problem, what does sort by really do . Pass it a block and 
    know the return value of the block is how I want to sort this.  What happens underneath
    the hood, calling array object and sort by. Sorting the number 
    a<=>b comparison operation
    sort returns 0, 1, or -1. 
    1 if a > b
    0 if a ==b
    -1 if a < b
