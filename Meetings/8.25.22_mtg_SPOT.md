written assessment
  - 3 hour time limit
  - 20 - 23 questions
  - save my answers
  - using Markdown
  - have editor open and copy and paste answers into the test.
  - set timers on every question, or every half hour
  - not spend too much time on one question, and lose herself in it.
  - be sure to run my code. Questions will ask what does it output, or asks me to do something with the code.  Make sure the code I am submitting works.  Use any notes or IED during the exam.  Make sure I am running my code all the time.
  - Make sure I am answering in the right amount of detail as we are working through the code snippets.  Don't need to go overboard. 
  - questions are going to be more specific. If not relevant to the question, don't say too much. Even though we are answering in precise language we are not overanswering the question.
  - Don't lose the forest for the trees.
Tips:
  - use references to specific pieces of code.  Talking about parameters, instead of arguments when it's the case.  The difference between a method call and a method definition.  
  - Taking a step back to reread my answer before I submit it to make sure I addressed each point.
  - working with others is really important especially for the interview.
  - dry run, mock test, helpful to practice and meet the 3 hour mark
  - time myself to answer each question in 10 minutes.

```Ruby
a = 'Bob' # initialize `a`
b = a # initialize b and point to `a`
a + ' Smith' # not assigning to anywhere

p a # invoking `p`, both reference string 'Bob', variables as pointers
p b

# what are a and b? Explain why.

a = 'Bob' # initialize `a`
b = a # initialize b and point to `a`
a << ' Smith' # now it's mutating, and both varaibles will reference the mutated string object

p a # invoking `p`, both reference string 'Bob', variables as pointers
p b

def bad_math
  if 2 > 3
    puts "bad math"
  end
end

p bad_math # => nil
# because the if conditional still evaluates, the return value is `nil`.

# Explain the following code, and identify the output. What underlying concepts does this demonstrate?

a = 'red' # local variable `a` and `b` to their own string objects
b = 'green'

loop do
  c = b
  a = c # c is referencing the same memory value as `b`
  break
end

puts a # => ? green
puts b # => ? green
puts c # => ? Error, undefined local variable error

# specifically mentioned that `c` was only in the scope of the block. Important to note that `c` doesn't come until last, so the two "green" strings will still be output.

#What is output and why?

a = 'Bob'

5.times do |a| # invoke the times method and pass it a do-end block. The local variable in the outer scope is inaccessible because of variable shadowing.
  a = 'Bill'
end
 
p a # => 'Bob'

def a_method(string)
  string = string << 'world' # shovel method is mutating
end

a = 'hello'
a_method(a) # => 'helloworld'
p a # => 'helloworld' pass by reference, mutated within the method

def a_method(string)
  string = string + 'world' # no longer mutating. variable assignment is not a mutating method.
end

a = 'hello'
a_method(a) # => 'helloworld'
p a # => 'hello' pass by value, not mutated within the method

# index assignment
# array was changed still referencing the same array object.  That particular element at index 0 was reassigned.  

# Explain the following code, and identify the output. What underlying concepts does this demonstrate?

a = [1, 2]
b = [3, 4]

array = [a, b] # => [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
p array.object_id # => [[1, 2], [3, 4]] => same object id

a[0] = 0 # => [0, 2]
#[]= index assignment
# `a` is still the same array object as well

p a # => [0, 2]
p array.object_id # => [[0, 2], [3, 4]] => same object id
# changing the specific element in the array

# Explain the following code, and identify the output. What underlying concepts does this demonstrate.

def greeting(words)
  puts words
end

def welcome
  puts words
end

message = 'Hi there!'

greeting(message) # => 'Hi there!'

welcome # => because of variable scope, and method having its own scope, NameError referencing line where it's actually happening

a = 'Bob'
b = 'Kate'

5.times do |a|
  a = 'Bill'
  b = 'Sarah'
end

p a # => 'Bob'
 # => variable shadowing because `a` block parameter passed to the do-end block. `a = 'Bill'` will do nothing and reassign local variable `a` inside the block.  Since `b` is defined outside the block it is accessible outside the block.
 p b # => 'Sarah'

letters = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']

capitals = letters.select do |letter|
  letter.upcase
end

p capitals # => ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e']
puts capitals # =>
# a
# b
# c
# d
# e

# the block passes the block parameter `letter` into the block and each letter will have the `upcase` method called on it.  The `select` method returns values that evaluate to `true` when evaluated by the block.  The elements all evaluate to truthy.  Evaluate whatever is in the code block and keeps whatever evaluates to truthy.  It does return everything in the array in this case because Ruby considers all strings as truthy.  `capitals` is being passed to `puts` as an argument.

# method declaration? when would I use it? 

def a_method(number) # method declaration
  number = 7 # contains the method, method body
end

a_method(number)

arr = [1, 2, 3] # passing values is an argument passed in
# parameter is a method parameter

arr.map do |num|
  num + 1 # `num` is a block variable here
end

arr.map do |num|
  num = arr
  b = "data"
end
