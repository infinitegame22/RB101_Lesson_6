pass by value : working with a copy of the object so any changes made to the copy do affect the original object in a method. In this case the string we pass into this method is a copy.
```Ruby
def no_change(string)
  string + 'howdy'
end

string1 = 'Rich'
no_change(string1)
p string1

def immutable_object(integer)
  integer += 1
end

integer = 1
immutable_object(integer)
```
Ruby appears to be passed a copy of the object.



In this example below, the variable `number` stores a reference to the String `"123-456-7890"`. We pass in a _copy_ of the `reference` to a String and store that reference for `Amy's Number`. Both `Amy's Number` and the `number` point to the same String.

Reassigning `Amy's Number` to a different string does _not_ change the original reference number stored in `number`. Thus, `Amy's Number` points to a different String, `999-999-9999`, while `number` still points to `123-456-7890`.

Ruby appears to act like Pass by value with immutable objects. 

PBR and PBV let us predict what a method will return/do.  Ruby isn't actually pass by value in the way that we think it is it just looks like it is. 

Ruby is pass by reference for mutable objects.

High risk of getting confused.

Ruby is pass by value of the reference. A reference is a pointer to a memory location.  

Reference - pointer to an address because it tells you where the house is. 

Next step: pass variable into some method, passing in location in memory and making a copy of the phone number. Take out another piece of paper and make a copy of the reference.  Two instances of the reference.  Make a copy of the phone number now. Ruby is always pass by reference of the value. Pass by reference value.  Depending on what the method is doing to whatever we are passing in, it depends on what is happening in the method determines whether or not it's pass by reference or value.

```Ruby
def upcase(name)
  name.upcase!
end

upcase('cruz')
```

It's a lot easier reading it.  Articulate it in my own words is hard.

```ruby
>> greeting = "Hello"
=> "Hello"
```
On line 2 the local variable `greeting` is initialized to the string object `'Hello'` and the string object is being returned.

```ruby
farewell = "hello"
greeting = farewell
p farewell.object_id
p greeting.object_id
```
same object id because each variable is pointing to the same string object.

What does it mean for an object to be immutable?
It cannot be changed
Examples include: 
  - integers
  - symbols
  - boolean
  - `nil`

```Ruby
friends = ["Joey", "Chandler", "Monica"]
friends[0] = "Rachel"
```
Setter methods also are mutating.  We are mutating the array referenced by `friends`.  We are reassigning the element at index 0 to the string "Rachel".

```Ruby
def add_three(number)
  return number + 3
  number + 4
end

p add_three(3)
```
This showcases the explicit `return`.  On line 84, 

```Ruby
a = 4
b = 2

2.times do |_|
  a = 5
  puts a
end

puts a
puts b

=begin
On lines 4-7 the `times` method is invoked on the integer do.  Inside the loop the local variable `a` is reassigned to the integer 5 and output twice.

On line 9, the `puts` method is invoked and passed the argument integer referenced by the variable `a`. This outputs the integer 5 which was reassigned inside the loop.
On line 10, the `puts` method is invoked and passed the argument integer referenced by the variable `b` and outputs the integer 2.  
This represents variable scope because a local variable initialized in the outer scope is accessible in the inner scope of the loop and reassigned inside the loop.  
=end

a = 'hello'
puts a
puts a.object_id

a += 'world'
puts a
puts a.object_id
```
On line 113 the `puts` method is passed the argument `a` which references the string object `'hello'`.  On line 114 the method `puts` is invoked and passed the argument 

```Ruby
a = 'name'
b = 'name'
c = 'name'

# Are these three local variables pointing to the same object?

puts a.object_id
puts b.object_id
puts c.object_id

=begin
These three objects are initialized to different places in memory, so all three object id's will be different.  A string is a mutable object that doesn't have a set place in memory.
=end

# And when we add these two lines of code... ?

a = c
b = a


a = 5 
b = 5
c = 5

puts a.object_id
puts b.object_id
puts c.object_id

=begin
The integer 5 has its own place in memory and these three variables are all pointing to the same space in memory, so they will have the same address. Immutable objects never change their address.
=end

a = :dog
b = :dog
c = :dog

puts a.object_id
puts b.object_id
puts c.object_id

=begin
Symbols are immutable objects and all have the same object id.

=end

a = "Hello"

if a
  puts "Hello is truthy"
else
  puts "Hello is falsey"
end


#We initialize the local variable `a` to the string `Hello`. All objects other than `nil` and `false` are truthy, so line 6 will output `Hello is truthy`. Example illustrates concept of truthiness. The example returns `nil`. 

# What does the following code return? What does it output? What concept does this demonstrate?

def test
  puts "written assessment"
end

var = test

if var
  puts "written assessment"
else
  puts "interview"
end
# outputs
  # "written assessment"
"interview"
# return value
  # nil
# concept
  # puts vs return

str = 'hi'

def str
  "I'm a method"
end

puts str 

=begin
On line 7 the method `puts` is invoked and passed the argument str. On line 1 `str` in initialized to the string object `'hi'`. Unfortunately, this has the same name as our method defined on lines 3-5. This demonstrates the concept of naming conventions ie making distinct and unique names for our variables and methods.  This also demonstrates precedence.  Variables take precedence over methods.  The output is 'hi'.  This also demonstrates syntactical sugar. Ruby allows for optional parentheses with a method call.

Instance methods can be loosely divided into four groups: *accessor*, *mutator*, *imperative*, and *predicate*.

**Accessor** (getter) methods return properties of the object or some representation of them. THey are best named by the property they return. That's usually a noun with some optional adjectives or possessive nouns. For example, `User#first_name`, `Book#rating`, `Report#results`.

Properties that describe some action that was performed on the entity are named with a verb in simple past tense, preposition and optionally a noun when it's not evident by whom was the action performed.  For example `Account#created_at`, `Post#published_by`, `Article#referenced_in_indeces`. In some languages, specifically Java, such methods are prefixed with `get_`, but in Ruby, it's not appreciated.

Also, note that method names take the class name into account, so if the class is named `User`, there is no point in having a method named `user_email` in that class. It's just `User#email`. It makes sense to have an entity as a part of the method name only when this entity is represented by another class, or when it refers to other instances of the class, not the same we're calling the method on.  For example, `Book#author_name`, `User#invited_by_user`.

**Mutator** (setter) methods are ones that used to assign properties of the object.  In Java, they are usually named as `set_<property_name>`, but in Ruby, it's just `<property_name>=(value)`. Namely, `User#email=(value)`, `Comment#body=(value)` etc.

If my mutator method has to accept two or more arguments, I can't have a method ending in `=`. Well, technically, I can, but to invoke it I'll have to use metaprogramming tricks.  In that case, I have to strongly reconsider my approaches, and why I need a setter with multiple arguments in the first place.  I probably need to create a separate class for that property at this point. Again, a good choice of names guides your application design.

**Imperative** methods either change some state (of the object, the app or even the outside world), or return some new data or transform existing data without mutating it. 

They are usually named with a verb or a phrase in an imperative mood. Like `Report#generate`, `Document#write_to_file(path)`, `MessageService#send(from, to, body)`. 

When I want to provide both a *"safe"* and a *"dangerous"* way of doing the same thing, name the *"dangerous"* method same as the *"safe"*, but with an *"!"* at the end.

Examples of `"safe"` and `"dangerous"` methods are `Array#sort` and `Array#sort!` from RubyCore library, where the first method returns a new sorted array, leaving the original intact (which is considered *"safe"*, unless I take my RAM very seriously).  And the other mutates the original array (which is in turn considered *"dangerous"*, because I may lose some data).

Other such examples are `#update` and `#update!` from `ActiveRecord::Persistence`, first one returning `false` in a case of validation errors and saving those errors in the model, and the second one raising an exception if the record is invalid. But if I don't provide safe alternatives and all methods in the class are dangerous, there's little point in using exclamation marks then.

**Predicate** methods always return *boolean*. They describe the object status in a yes/no manner, or if it's a private method they can contain a names part of some long conditional.  Their names should always end with a questions mark.

Grammatically the names can be anything from adjectives like `TrafficLight#green?` to full fledged sentences like `WeatherService#should_i_take_an_umbrella?`.

The general rule of thumb for picking a name for a predicate method: it should be something you can read in a question intonation, and it would make sense.

Of course, there may be methods that don't fit into any of these four categories, and we did not cover class methods here are all, but in general, it's all the same: the name should make sense and it should contain just the right amount of context to be clear -- not more and not less.
