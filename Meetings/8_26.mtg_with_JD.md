Explain what **local variable scope is**: 
outer scope and local scope
if I initialize variable `a` in the outer scope of the following program:
`a = 2`

and then access `a` in the inner scope of the following block:
`loo


**Scope** - area, a section. 
**Variable** - little containers that point to spaces in memory
**Local**: NOT GLOBAL. Restricted to some space. "Farm-fresh".

**Variable scope** - The section of code where we can access the variable. 

[name] ------>                [ "Amy" ]  [  ]  [  ]


**Local scope** - area in which you defined something.


**Local variable scope** - is the section of code we can use a variable, and this section of code is determined by where we initialize the local variable.
