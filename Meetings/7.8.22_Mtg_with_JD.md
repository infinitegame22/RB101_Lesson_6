For each of these collection objects where the value 3 occurs, demonstrate how you would change this to 4.



Practice Problem #4
```Ruby

For each of these collection objects where the value 3 occurs, demonstrate how you would change this to 4.

arr1 = [1, [2, 3], 4] 

# => arr1[1] => [2, 3]
# => arr1[1][1] = 4 => 4

arr2 = [{a: 1}, {b: 2, c: [7, 6, 5], d: 4}, 3]

# => arr2[2] = 4

hsh1 = {first: [1, 2, [3]]}

# => hsh1[:first][2][0] = 4

hsh2 = {['a'] => {a: ['1', :two, 3], b: 4}, 'b' => 5}

# => hsh2[["a"]] => {a: ['1', :two, 3], b: 4}, 'b' => 5}
# => hsh2[["a"]][:a] => ["1", :two, 3]
# => hsh2[["a"]][:a][2] = 4

# One of the most frequently used real-world string properties is that of "string substitution", where we take a hard-coded string and modify it with various parameters from our program.

# Given this previously seen family hash, print out the name, age and gender of each family member:

munsters = {
  "Herman" => { "age" => 32, "gender" => "male" },
  "Lily" => { "age" => 30, "gender" => "female" },
  "Grandpa" => { "age" => 402, "gender" => "male" },
  "Eddie" => { "age" => 10, "gender" => "male" },
  "Marilyn" => { "age" => 23, "gender" => "female"}
}

# example sentence:
# (Name) is a (age)-year-old (male or female).

munsters.each do |name, stats|
  puts "#{name} is a #{stats['age']}-year-old #{stats['gender']}"
end

Practice Problem 7
Given this code, what would be the final values of a and b? Try to work this out without running the code.

Copy Code
a = 2
b = [5, 8]
arr = [a, b]

# arr = [2, [5, 8]]
arr[0] += 2 # => 2 + 2 = 4 => arr = [4, [5, 8]]
arr[1][0] -= a # => 3 => [4, [5, 8]] 
arr[1][0] = 5 - 2
# arr = [4, [3, 8]]

puts a #=> 2
puts b #=> [3, 8]
puts arr #=> [4, [3, 8]]

# Using the each method, write some code to output all of the vowels from the strings.

# Copy Code
hsh = {first: ['the', 'quick'], second: ['brown', 'fox'], third: ['jumped'], fourth: ['over', 'the', 'lazy', 'dog']}

# 1st level - a hash four key - value pairs

# access values from key/value pairs in hsh 
#   access strings in values
#     iterate through strings characters
#       oputput character if character is a vowel

VOWEL = 'aeiouAEIOU'

hsh.each do |_, values|
  values.each do |strings|
    strings.each_char do |chr|
      puts chr if VOWEL.include?(chr)
    end
  end
end
