# Obi and Greg 9.2.22

The questions that were on the wiki page, some of the questions are those questions.  Are they even different? There are some differences.  Those questions are pulled straight out of the curriculum.  Only have access to the old questions. 

2-3 90 minute blocks of trying to write the questions out. A lot of writing. He doesn't feel like he is a fast thinker/typer. Takes his time with things. Not ideal for assessments.  

having to correct myself and go back to the answers is helpful to go over the concept.  What would it take to be my favorite teacher?

Allowed to go back and make things right. Required to go back and review.  He got a 94. It's all spelled out and no surprises there.  No conditional threshold.  Still have to correct all the answers.  Those 6 points he missed, he had to go back and adjust them.  3 of the points were part of a mistake of staying on the deadline.  Said something wrong or missed a detail.  Misunderstood the question or concept. Now he's got it. That concept and looking at all of those questions, not giving away an answer in jeopardy of student code. 

He totally misunderstood before. Obi wished there was a way to do that for the interview assessment.  3 months prepping for the interview.  Scary and solving and bringing in questions from places he doesn't know. Code reviews, see his code.  think things that people. Look for code and see how he approached it. On another level. Different skill set. Richard and JD are on a different level. My head is spinning.

```Ruby

# start of program
ant = ['apple', 'orange', ['carrot'], 5] # array object, count : 1
p ant.object_id
p ant[0].object_id
p ant[2].object_id
bat = ant[2] # ['carrot'] array object
p bat.object_id == bat[0].object_id

cat = bat
p cat.object_id
dog = cat[0] # => 'carrot', count : 3
p dog.object_id

# After the four lines of code are run, how many objects have been defined and what do each variable point to?

=begin

There are four variables initialized in this program. There are 3 objects defined.  The local variable `ant` points to an array object with 4 elements. The local variable `bat` points to the element at the 2nd index of the array object referenced by the variable `ant`. The local variable `cat` points to the array object in memory referenced by `bat`. On line 27 the variable `dog` is initialized to the element at index 0 of the array object referenced by `cat`, which is the string object `'carrot'`.  This demonstrates variables as pointers because the variables `cat` and `bat` are pointing to the same space in memory.
=end
```

`ant` points to an object which it references.  An array is not really this.  What is here is a refernce.  It creates another object.  This also has a reference.  An array of 4 elements.  This variable `ant` point to an array and knows this is one object.  He knows that `ant` has the address.  Remember that an array's elements also have their own references which point to something else.  Another object is created [0]. There are actually 6 objects!! initialized on line 24 and passed around as references.  

Passing around references and we say that this is mutated.  This is supposed to be deleted from this object. Does it affect this one?

```Ruby

ant = ['apple', 'orange', ['carrot'], 5]
bat = ant[2] #=> ['carrot]'
cat = bat #=> ['carrot]'
dog = cat[0] #=> 'carrot'

ant.delete(ant[2])
# ant[2][0].upcase!

p ant # => ['apple', 'orange', 5]
p bat # => ['carrot']
p cat # => ['carrot']
p dog # => 'carrot'


def add_name(arr, name)
  arr = arr << name
end

names = ['bob', 'kim']
add_name(names, 'jim')
puts names

# output = ['bob', 'kim', 'jim']


```
The method `add_name` is defined with two parameters between lines 32-34. On line 36, the local variable `names` is initialized to the array `['bob', 'kim']`.

Does the mutating method lose its mutating quality if it points to the object?

# =begin 12:45
# DESCRIPTION:
# You know how sometimes you write the the same word twice in a sentence, but then don't notice that it happened? For example, you've been distracted for a second. Did you notice that "the" is doubled in the first sentence of this description?

# As as aS you can see, it's not easy to spot those errors, especially if words differ in case, like "as" at the beginning of this sentence.

# Write a function that counts the number of sections repeating the same word (case insensitive). The occurence of two or more equal words next after each other counts as one.
